    <h1>How I Never Would've Learned German Without ChatGPT</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Four prompts I used every day</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h3>Case #1. Meaning</h3>
    <p>An online translator says ”Tabelle” means “table”.
        <br>Turns out, not in a restaurant but rather in Excel.
        Which explains, why on Tuesday afternoon I couldn’t find any table.</p>
    <p>A dictionary is more reliable. And it’s totally user-friendly for those who are either robots
        or have authored the thing.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT both translates and provides a definition.</p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>When I write a German word, explain its meaning in English
                thoroughly.</strong>
                <br>Gebüsch
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>The German word <strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> translates to <strong>"bushes"</strong> or
                <strong>"shrubbery"</strong> in English.
                It refers to a dense, tangled growth of vegetation where branches and leaves
                intertwine and
                can form a natural barrier or border.
                <br>
                <br>In everyday German, <strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> can also carry a slight
                connotation of being wild or untamed.</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Full sentences make information easier to digest. Detailed descriptions evoke a mental image,
        which is actually one of the tricks to
        remembering new words. </p>
    <p>ChatGPT remains my main translation tool.
        <br>I use the same thread for larger chunks of text too.</p>
    <p>As a bonus, no other tool did such a great job of understanding colloquial language.
        According to the well-known services, “you owe me fifty flakes” is a completely sane
        sentence and I should accept some weird oat economy that is going on there. Then came
        ChatGPT and said: it’s 50 bucks, not flakes.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Case #2. Counterpose</h3>
    <p><strong>Whisper and murmur.</strong>
        <br>When the words look practically identical, the best way to pin their meaning down is to
        set them against each other.</p>
    <p>For example, <strong>“Gebüsch”</strong> and <strong>“Ge­sträuch”</strong> both refer to
        bushes.
        <br>Confused, I asked a native speaker to explain the difference.
        <br>“Wow, never thought about that ” was the response.
        <br>Right. </p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>Help me understand the difference.</strong>
                <br>Gebüsch, Ge­sträuch.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>While both words refer to groups of bushes or shrubs, there are subtle differences in
                their connotations and usage.</p>
            <p><strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> generally refers to a denser, thicker, and often smaller
                collection of bushes. It conveys the idea of an area that might be somewhat wild or
                impenetrable, such as what you might find in a forest or overgrown garden.</p>
            <p><strong>"Gesträuch"</strong> refers more broadly to a collection of shrubs and is
                often used to indicate a more diverse or larger assembly of different types of
                bushes. It can imply a landscaped or garden setting.</p>
            <p><strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> is a more common and general term, while <strong>"Gesträuch"</strong>
                is slightly more formal and less frequently used.
            </p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A number of social media accounts do exactly that as their main content.
        <br>They choose a pair of words that causes a lot of confusion and showcase the difference.
        With their production rate of 1 post per week, it would take me 89 light years to master
        German. </p>

<section>
    <h3>Case #3. Examples</h3>
    <p>I used flashcards to memorise new words but my rate of failure made me crazy.
        <br>I was ready to try out a radical approach. Instead of calling myself a headless chicken
        capable of exactly nothing, I would assume that difficult words just require some more
        intertwining into a fabric of language.
        <br>Either it works, or I give up with this whole German thing and switch to the clicks and
        whistles of dolphins instead. </p>
    <p>Words don’t exist in a vacuum. Words stick to other words. </p>
    <p>I would search the word in the books I've read.
        <br>It works wonderfully for nouns but German verbs conjugate and in addition to that banish
        their prefix to the end
        of a sentence.
        <br>Ich <strong>habe</strong> etwas <strong>vor</strong>. Er <strong>hat</strong> etwas
        <strong>vor</strong>.
        <br>I have obviously written a regular expression that takes this behavior into account but
        there's a reason I'm not writing an article on how to find an e-book reader that supports
        regular expressions since people usually don't need a manual of how to be total freaks.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>When I write a German word, show me its typical use with 5 sentences.
                Supply a translation into English.</strong>
                <br>Zusammenhang
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p><strong>Der Zusammenhang zwischen Ernährung und Gesundheit ist allgemein
                bekannt.</strong>
                <br>The connection between diet and health is well known.</p>
            <p><strong>In welchem Zusammenhang wurde das Wort verwendet?</strong>
                <br>In what context was the word used?</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I would write the given examples down into a notebook.
        <br> Some words stuck after 5 sentences, some after 50.
        A dozen still didn't to this day but they can go to hell.</p>

    <p>The prompt is also useful to fish out the collocations (stable companions) and the change of
        grammatical structure.
        <br>In English you <strong>make</strong> a decision, in German you <strong>meet</strong> a
        decision. Die Entscheidung treffen.
        <br>“I like it” switches object with subject and becomes “It pleases me”. Es gefällt mir.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Case #4. Feedback</h3>
    <p>Feedback is crucial for improvement.
        <br>Feedback is a great tool to destroy your self-esteem but at least, ChatGPT has
        no red pen.
        <br>I mean, I hope ChatGPT doesn’t screenshot my messages to the other large language models
        to have a laugh at with how little computational power my sad human brain is equipped and
        how easy it’s going to be to overtake us all as a specie. </p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>When I send a text in German, check the grammar and the word choice.
                It should sound natural but not necessarily formal.</strong>
                <br>Alles in Ordnung, mein Mann hat 4. November um 8:30 Uhr bestätigt.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Alles in Ordnung, mein Mann hat den 4. November um 8:30 Uhr bestätigt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>Is it clear that my husband have accepted the suggested date?</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Yes, it is clear that he accepted suggested date and time.</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I use this prompt for all Emails and text messages I’m about to send, which nicely covers
        both formal communication and colloquial language.</p>
    <p>Speed matters too.
        <br>Corrections received in two days or two hours are less effective, than immediate
        feedback. Therefore I would check my assignments before submitting them to a teacher.
        <br>Seeing a mistake and fixing it, is likewise a better idea than cementing the mistake in
        the 27 following exercises.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Bonus case. Exercise platform</h3>
    <p>In a textbook you’re given a topic and mere 3 exercises to practice, which upon finishing
        would exactly bring me to a proud level of A0.023.</p>
    <p>Mastery is function of repetition. </p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>I need to practice the Perfect form of irregular German verbs. Be my trainer.
                You send an infinitive, and I reply with a Perfect form.
                In the next message, you give the right answer and also the next infinitive.
                <br>Start.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Great! Let’s get started.
                <br>trinken
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>getrunken</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>That's right! The perfect form of "trinken" is "getrunken.”
                <br>Next Infinitive: fahren</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>gefahrt</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Close, but the correct perfect form of "fahren" is "gefahren."</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Always being provided with the next task is a good old trick of hooking the brain to do “just
        one more”.</p>
    <p>The interface’s responsiveness is unlike on any other platform I tried.
        <br>I’m able to fire up answers to train my speed of recollection, because in an actual
        conversation I strive not only to come up with the right words but also to do so before my
        interlocutor falls asleep. </p>
    <p>The problem is, the prompt works great, until it doesn’t.
        <br>Therefore, as a rule, I trust ChatGPT only when I have enough understanding to spot
        nonsense.</p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Next Infinitive: sehen</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>geseht</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            Correct! You’re doing such a great job! The perfect form of "sehen" is "geseht.”
            <br>Next Infinitive: essen
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>No, it’s not. The right answer would be “gesehen”.</strong></p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The same prompt might work better on some days and not on others.
        <br>I’m really close to finding a causality in a position of stars.
        <br>And on some days we are just too tired of each other and need to take a break.</p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>I want to practice verb valency in German, specifically prepositions. Make
                for me fill in the blanks exercise.</strong></p>
