    <h1>How I Never Would've Learned German Without ChatGPT</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Four prompts I used every day</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h3>Case #1. Meaning</h3>
    <p>An online translator says “Tabelle” means “table.”
        <br>Turns out, it’s the kind you find not in a restaurant but rather in Excel — which
        explains
        why on Tuesday afternoon, I couldn’t find a single table.</p>
    <p>A dictionary is more reliable. And it's totally user-friendly if you're either a robot or
        have authored the thing.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT can translate and provide a definition at the same time.</p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>When I write a German word, explain its meaning in English
                thoroughly.</strong>
                <br>Gebüsch
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>The German word <strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> translates to <strong>"bushes"</strong> or
                <strong>"shrubbery"</strong> in English.
                It refers to a dense, tangled growth of vegetation where branches and leaves
                intertwine and
                can form a natural barrier or border.
                <br>
                <br>In everyday German, <strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> can also carry a slight
                connotation of being wild or untamed.</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Full sentences make information easier to digest. A detailed description evokes a mental
        image, which is actually one of the tricks to remembering new words.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT remains my go-to translation tool.
        <br>I use the same thread for larger chunks of text too.</p>
    <p>As a bonus, no other tool does such a great job with colloquial language. According to the
        well-known services, “you owe me fifty flakes” is a perfectly sane sentence, and I should
        just accept some weird oat economy going on there. Then came ChatGPT and said: it’s 50
        bucks, not flakes.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Case #2. Counterpose</h3>
    <p><strong>Whisper and murmur.</strong>
        <br>When words look practically identical, the best way to pin down their meaning is to set
        them against each other.</p>
    <p>For example, <strong>“Gebüsch”</strong> and <strong>“Ge­sträuch”</strong> both refer to
        bushes.
        <br>Confused, I asked a native speaker to explain the difference.
        <br>“Wow, never thought about that,” was the response.
        <br>Right.</p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>Help me understand the difference.</strong>
                <br>Gebüsch, Ge­sträuch.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>While both words refer to groups of bushes or shrubs, there are subtle differences in
                their connotations and usage.</p>
            <p><strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> generally refers to a denser, thicker, and often smaller
                collection of bushes. It conveys the idea of an area that might be somewhat wild or
                impenetrable, such as what you might find in a forest or overgrown garden.</p>
            <p><strong>"Gesträuch"</strong> refers more broadly to a collection of shrubs and is
                often used to indicate a more diverse or larger assembly of different types of
                bushes. It can imply a landscaped or garden setting.</p>
            <p><strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> is a more common and general term, while <strong>"Gesträuch"</strong>
                is slightly more formal and less frequently used.
            </p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A number of social media accounts do exactly that as their main content.
        <br>They pick a pair of words that often causes confusion and break down the difference.
        At a rate of one post per week, it would take me about 89 light years to master German.
    </p>

<section>
    <h3>Case #3. Examples</h3>
    <p>I used flashcards to memorize new words, but my failure rate was driving me crazy.
        <br>I was ready to try something radical. Instead of calling myself a headless chicken
        capable of exactly nothing, I decided to assume that difficult words just need a bit more
        interweaving into the fabric of the language.
        <br>Either it works, or I’ll give up on German altogether and switch to the clicks and
        whistles of dolphins instead.</p>
    <p>Words don’t exist in a vacuum. Words stick to other words.</p>
    <p>I did look up problematic words in the books I’d read.
        <br>It works beautifully for nouns, but German verbs conjugate and, to make things worse,
        banish their prefix to the end of the sentence.
        <br><em>Ich <strong>habe</strong> etwas <strong>vor</strong>. Er <strong>hat</strong> etwas
            <strong>vor</strong>.</em>
        <br>Obviously, I’ve written a regular expression (a coded text search pattern) to account
        for this behavior, but there’s a reason I’m not writing an article on “How to Find an E-Book
        Reader That Supports Regular Expressions” — people don’t usually need a manual on how to be
        a total freak.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>When I write a German word, show me its typical use with 5 sentences.
                Supply a translation into English.</strong>
                <br>Zusammenhang
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p><strong>Der Zusammenhang zwischen Ernährung und Gesundheit ist allgemein
                bekannt.</strong>
                <br>The connection between diet and health is well known.</p>
            <p><strong>In welchem Zusammenhang wurde das Wort verwendet?</strong>
                <br>In what context was the word used?</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I wrote the examples down in a notebook.
        <br> Some words stuck after 5 sentences, some after 50. A dozen still haven’t to this day,
        but they can go to hell.</p>

    <p>The prompt is also handy for spotting collocations (common word pairings) and shifts in
        grammatical structure.
        <br>In English, you <strong>make</strong> a decision; in German, you <strong>meet</strong> a
        decision. <em>Die Entscheidung treffen.</em>
        <br><strong>“I like it”</strong> switches object with subject and becomes <strong>“It
            pleases me”</strong>. <em>Es gefällt mir.</em></p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Case #4. Feedback</h3>
    <p>Feedback is crucial for improvement.
        <br>Feedback is a great tool to destroy your self-esteem but at least, ChatGPT has
        no red pen.
        <br>I mean, I hope ChatGPT doesn’t screenshot my messages to the other large language models
        to have a laugh at with how little computational power my sad human brain is equipped and
        how easy it’s going to be to overtake us all as a specie. </p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>When I send a text in German, check the grammar and the word choice.
                It should sound natural but not necessarily formal.</strong>
                <br>Alles in Ordnung, mein Mann hat 4. November um 8:30 Uhr bestätigt.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Alles in Ordnung, mein Mann hat den 4. November um 8:30 Uhr bestätigt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>Is it clear that my husband have accepted the suggested date?</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Yes, it is clear that he accepted suggested date and time.</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I use this prompt for all Emails and text messages I’m about to send, which nicely covers
        both formal communication and colloquial language.</p>
    <p>Speed matters too.
        <br>Corrections received in two days or two hours are less effective, than immediate
        feedback. Therefore I would check my assignments before submitting them to a teacher.
        <br>Seeing a mistake and fixing it, is likewise a better idea than cementing the mistake in
        the 27 following exercises.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Bonus case. Exercise platform</h3>
    <p>In a textbook you’re given a topic and mere 3 exercises to practice, which upon finishing
        would exactly bring me to a proud level of A0.023.</p>
    <p>Mastery is function of repetition. </p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>I need to practice the Perfect form of irregular German verbs. Be my trainer.
                You send an infinitive, and I reply with a Perfect form.
                In the next message, you give the right answer and also the next infinitive.
                <br>Start.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Great! Let’s get started.
                <br>trinken
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>getrunken</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>That's right! The perfect form of "trinken" is "getrunken.”
                <br>Next Infinitive: fahren</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>gefahrt</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Close, but the correct perfect form of "fahren" is "gefahren."</p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Always being provided with the next task is a good old trick of hooking the brain to do “just
        one more”.</p>
    <p>The interface’s responsiveness is unlike on any other platform I tried.
        <br>I’m able to fire up answers to train my speed of recollection, because in an actual
        conversation I strive not only to come up with the right words but also to do so before my
        interlocutor falls asleep. </p>
    <p>The problem is, the prompt works great, until it doesn’t.
        <br>Therefore, as a rule, I trust ChatGPT only when I have enough understanding to spot
        nonsense.</p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message response">
            <p>Next Infinitive: sehen</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>geseht</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message response">
            Correct! You’re doing such a great job! The perfect form of "sehen" is "geseht.”
            <br>Next Infinitive: essen
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>No, it’s not. The right answer would be “gesehen”.</strong></p>
        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The same prompt might work better on some days and not on others.
        <br>I’m really close to finding a causality in a position of stars.
        <br>And on some days we are just too tired of each other and need to take a break.</p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message">
            <p><strong>I want to practice verb valency in German, specifically prepositions. Make
