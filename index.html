    <h1>How I’d had never learned German without ChatGPT</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Four prompts that I’ve used daily</p>
    <br>
</header>

<section>
    <h3>Case #1. Meaning</h3>
    <p>An online translator tells you that ”Tabelle” means “table”.
        <br>Turns out, not in a restaurant but rather in Excel.
        <br>Which explains, why on Tuesday afternoon I couldn’t find any table.</p>
    <p>A dictionary is more reliable.
        <br>And it’s totally user-friendly for those who are either robots or have authored the
        thing.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT both translates and provides a definition.</p>

    <blockquote class="chat-container">
        <div class="chat-message right">
            <p><strong>When I write a German word, explain its meaning in English
                thoroughly.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>Gebüsch
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message left">
            <p>The German word <strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> translates to <strong>"bushes"</strong> or
                <strong>"shrubbery"</strong> in English.
                It refers to a dense, tangled growth of vegetation where branches and leaves
                intertwine and
                can form a natural barrier or border.
                <br>
                <br>In everyday German, <strong>"Gebüsch"</strong> can also carry a slight
                connotation of being wild or untamed.</p>
        </div>

    <h3>Case #2. Counterpose</h3>
    <p>In minimalist design, <strong>content is king</strong>. Every design element should serve a
        purpose and enhance the reader’s focus on the content.</p>

    <p>White space, or negative space, plays a crucial role in directing the reader’s attention and
        creating a balanced layout. For example:</p>

    <p>Keeping a simple, cohesive color scheme enhances readability and maintains visual calm.
        Instead of using many colors, try focusing on shades of one or two main colors for a sleek
        look.</p>

        both functional and visually pleasing.</p>
