<section>
    <p>The story is 100% true and happened around 2013 in the sweet town of Kemerovo, Russia.
        At the time, I was studying economics at university and working full-time as a project
        manager at a provincial IT company.
    </p>
    <p>At the end of the semester, to complete the Tax Law course, I had to take an exam.</p>
    <p>Here is the thing: some people don’t vibe with pop music.
        <br>I don’t vibe with exams.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>In many cases, a student could exchange a banknote for an A, or a smaller banknote for a B,
        if you know what I mean. But a project manager in a provincial IT company doesn’t negotiate
        with a client about the exact shade of their new logo twenty times, only to spend all her
        hard-earned money on stupid exams. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Tax Law course also included weekly tests, which were written, it seems, alongside the
        Bible and had remained unchanged ever since. The first students must have submitted answers
        on stone walls in a cave; later, the process was automated.</p>
    <p>The computer program saved hundreds of hours of labour, but it had a small imperfection – if
        you clicked twice, the correct answer would be highlighted.</p>
    <p>The results showed that, for years, even the Federal Tax Service didn't know the tax law as
        well as the students at my university.</p>
    <p>The professor asked the IT department to fix the bug. They replied with something about the
        benefits of the algorithm complexity within a state machine on a remote server. After that,
        my professor never asked anything again.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I smelled opportunity.</p>
    <p>What if I developed a new program? Would it count for a final A in the course? <br>It would.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>In truth, a project manager in a provincial IT company can develop nothing. For the job, you
        need no hard skills – just a bright smile and a tendency to overestimate your own
        capabilities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My professor brought a stack of papers. She looked pleased.
        <br>The stack was thick enough to serve as a press for sauerkraut. It would have taken 100
        years and three days to retype it all. (There was no AI text recognition back then.)
        <br>She had outsmarted me. I should have just learned 15 exam questions and sat still.
    </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, one must never underestimate a project manager in a provincial IT company.
        Nothing builds character quite like integrating with an ERP system. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Since the tests hadn’t ever changed, the old, flawed program already had them digitised. </p>
    <p>The computer rooms at the university had bars on windows and steel doors. Pentium 3 was
        guarded more thoroughly than a member of the Witness Protection Program. </p>
    <p>Luckily, every class has that one student no one has ever seen. So when a girl walked in and
        copied a couple of files onto a USB stick, no one batted an eye.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Internet has everything.
        <br>Included the aforementioned flawed program and the codec to recover all the test
        questions and answers.
    </p>
    <p>The Internet also had another program that worked great, didn't give away all the right
        answers, and was distributed under an open-source license – meaning everyone could use it
        for free.</p>
    <p>It took me no more than an hour to get the job done.
        <br>The hardest part was inventing a heartfelt story for the professor about how hard I
        worked and how long it had taken me.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I graduated from university as a straight-A student. </p>
    <p>Until the last semester, I had to take a total of exactly one exam. In most cases, I had to
        study hard for that to happen, but that would make an extremely lame story.</p>
    <p>Another time, a professor taught market economy but hated it guts. To skip the exam, I had to
        recite Karl Marks. “Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!”
        <br>Don't ask.

    <p>A leading online translation service says <strong>“Tabelle”</strong> means
        <strong>“table.”</strong>
        <br>Turns out, it’s the kind you find not in a restaurant but rather in Excel — which
        explains
        why on Tuesday afternoon, I couldn’t find a single table.</p>
